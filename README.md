# Fotomatic

An off-platform project on my web development course - the files (html, css and all relevant image resources) have been provided for a webpage. However, it is not working as it is not responsive to changing browser size/different user screen sizes.

The task is to fix the broken files - simulating a typical freelance project or client fix.

The mock-up can be seen [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png)
